# firestone-data-analytics
A small set of scripts written to programmatically assess firestone games. Still very much a WIP, but may save someone the trouble of duping work. 

I am not an app developer, and these scripts are not polished. They are made to run at your own leisure, usually directly editing variables in the scripts themselves.
